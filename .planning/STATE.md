# State: Recept Footer & Legal Pages

**Updated:** 2026-01-28

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** The app feels trustworthy and complete with proper legal pages and a polished footer visible everywhere.

**Current Focus:** Phase 1 — Footer Infrastructure

## Current Position

**Phase:** 1 of 2 (Footer Infrastructure)
**Plan:** None (awaiting `/gsd:plan-phase 1`)
**Status:** Pending
**Progress:** [░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 0/6 requirements (0%)

### Phase Breakdown

- Phase 1 (Footer Infrastructure): 0/3 requirements complete
- Phase 2 (Content Pages): 0/3 requirements complete

## Performance Metrics

**Completed:**
- Requirements: 0/6 (0%)
- Phases: 0/2 (0%)
- Plans: 0/0 (N/A)

**Efficiency:**
- Phase completion rate: N/A (no phases completed)
- Blocker rate: 0 blockers, 0 resolutions
- Revision rate: 0 revisions, 0 plans

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Two-phase structure | Footer must exist before pages can link to it; natural delivery boundary | 2026-01-28 |
| Swedish routes (/om, /integritetspolicy, /villkor) | Consistent with existing app route convention | 2026-01-28 |

### Active Todos

(None — awaiting phase planning)

### Blockers

(None)

### Technical Patterns Discovered

(None yet — will be discovered during execution)

## Session Continuity

**Last Action:** Roadmap created with 2 phases derived from 6 requirements.

**Next Action:** Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to create executable plan for Footer Infrastructure.

**Context for Next Session:**
- This is a small, focused project (footer redesign + 3 content pages)
- Footer component must work in both (main) and (auth) layouts without duplication
- All content must be in Swedish
- Footer currently exists as minimal component: just copyright line in muted container
- No research was conducted (not needed for small scope)
