| 2 — Content Pages | Users can access About, Privacy, Terms pages with real Swedish content | PASSED | 6/6 truths verified |

No orphaned exports. No missing connections.

## E2E User Flows

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Main page → Footer link → Content page | User on main → clicks footer link → content page renders with footer visible | COMPLETE |
| Auth page → Footer link → Content page | User on login/register → clicks footer link → content page renders with footer visible | COMPLETE |

**Score: 2/2 flows complete (100%)**

## Anti-Patterns

None detected across either phase. No TODO/FIXME/placeholder patterns found.

## Tech Debt

| Phase | Item | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 02 — Content Pages | Lint warning: unescaped quotes in villkor/page.tsx (`react/no-unescaped-entities`) | Low |

**Total: 1 item across 1 phase** — non-blocking, cosmetic lint warning.

## Build Status

Build passes with zero errors. All routes generated:
- `/om` — About page
- `/integritetspolicy` — Privacy Policy page
- `/villkor` — Terms of Service page

## Human Verification Recommended

Both phase verifications flagged these for manual review:
1. Visual typography and layout rendering
2. Mobile responsive behavior
3. Footer navigation flow in browser
4. Swedish content quality and tone
5. Cross-page footer consistency

These are quality checks, not functionality blockers.

## Conclusion

All 6 requirements satisfied. Both phases passed verification. All cross-phase connections verified. Both E2E flows complete. Build succeeds. One minor lint warning as tech debt.

**Milestone v1 is ready for completion.**
