## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Used Next.js Link for client-side navigation to content pages
- Copyright entity is Matrummet (brand name, not app name Recept)
- Background-only footer separation (bg-muted/30, no border-t)
- Auth layout flex-1 for sticky footer pattern
- Straightforward, minimal content tone (no personal backstory)
- Plain Swedish language (no legal jargon)
- "Vad vi INTE gor" privacy section for trust building
- Typography plugin via @plugin directive (Tailwind v4 syntax)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Footer missing from auth pages (login, register) — added via shared component import
- Missing node_modules during Phase 1 build — resolved with pnpm install

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Lint warning: unescaped quotes in villkor/page.tsx (react/no-unescaped-entities) — low severity
