  <action>
    1. In `apps/frontend/app/globals.css`, add `@plugin '@tailwindcss/typography';` on line 2 (immediately after `@import "tailwindcss";` and before `@theme {`).

    2. Create `apps/frontend/app/(main)/om/page.tsx` as a Server Component with:
       - Export `metadata` with title "Om Recept" and a Swedish description
       - Default export `OmPage` function
       - Wrapper: `<div className="mx-auto max-w-prose px-4 py-12">`
       - Content: `<article className="prose prose-neutral">`
       - h1: "Om Recept"
       - Content tone: Straightforward and minimal, purely factual. No personal backstory.
       - Cover: What the app is (a digital cookbook for managing recipes), key features (Swedish full-text search, categories, shopping lists, ingredient management), who it's for (anyone who wants to organize their recipes digitally)
       - Keep it to 2-3 short paragraphs — no fluff
       - Entity name: "Matrummet" when referring to the project/brand
       - End with last-updated date: `<p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">Senast uppdaterad: 28 januari 2026</p>`
       - All content in Swedish

    Run `pnpm build` from the repo root. Verify no build errors. Verify the file exists at the correct path.

    Typography plugin is enabled in globals.css. About page exists at /om with Swedish content, metadata export, and reading-optimized prose layout.

  <name>Task 2: Create Privacy Policy page</name>
  <files>
    apps/frontend/app/(main)/integritetspolicy/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    Create `apps/frontend/app/(main)/integritetspolicy/page.tsx` as a Server Component with:
    - Export `metadata` with title "Integritetspolicy - Recept" and Swedish description about data handling
    - Default export `IntegritetspolicyPage` function
    - Wrapper: `<div className="mx-auto max-w-prose px-4 py-12">`
    - Content: `<article className="prose prose-neutral">`
    - h1: "Integritetspolicy"

    Sections (use `<section>` with `<h2>` headings):

    1. **Vilken data vi samlar in** — List:
       - E-postadress (for login)
       - Lösenord (stored as bcrypt hash, never readable)
       - Receptdata (recipes, ingredients, instructions, categories the user creates)
       - Stripe-kund-ID (for payment processing — we never store card details, Stripe handles that)

    2. **Hur vi använder din data** — Explain:
       - Authentication (email + password hash)
       - Displaying and managing your recipes
       - Processing payments through Stripe (only customer ID stored)

    3. **Cookies** — Explain:
       - Only functional cookies: JWT session cookie for authentication
       - No analytics cookies, no third-party tracking cookies
       - No cookie consent banner needed because we only use strictly necessary cookies

    4. **Vad vi INTE gör** — Emphasize clearly:
       - No Google Analytics or any analytics service
       - No tracking pixels
       - No third-party advertising
       - No selling or sharing data with third parties
       - No behavioral tracking

    5. **Radera ditt konto** — Explain:
       - Users can delete their account and all associated data through account settings
       - Deletion is permanent and removes all recipes, account data, and Stripe customer reference

    6. **Kontakt** — Brief:
       - Questions about personal data can be directed to Matrummet

    End with: `<p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">Senast uppdaterad: 28 januari 2026</p>`

    All content in plain Swedish — avoid legal jargon, explain simply.

    Run `pnpm build` from the repo root. Verify no build errors.

       - These terms apply to use of Recept, operated by Matrummet
       - By using the service, you accept these terms

    2. **Konto** — Explain:
       - You need an account to use the service
       - You are responsible for keeping your login credentials secure
       - One account per person

    3. **Ditt innehåll** — Content ownership:
       - You own the recipes and content you create
       - By using the service, you give Matrummet a license to display your content within the app (necessary for the service to function)
       - You can delete your content at any time

    4. **Acceptabel användning** — Acceptable use:
       - Use the service for its intended purpose (recipe management)
       - Don't attempt to access other users' data
       - Don't use automated tools to scrape or overload the service

    5. **Ansvarsbegränsning** — Limitation of liability:
       - The service is provided "as is"
       - Matrummet is not responsible for data loss (though we take reasonable measures to protect data)
       - Keep your own backups of important recipes

    6. **Ändringar** — Changes:
       - Matrummet may update these terms
       - Continued use after changes means acceptance
